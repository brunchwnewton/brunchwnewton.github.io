excerpt: "This comprehensive paper details the core of Aethic reasoning, decoupling the Einsteinian flow of time from quantum collapse events. It establishes the first three Aethic postulates, defining informational reality as reference-dependent and using a two-generational model of state inheritance to distinguish coherence from decoherence."

This comprehensive paper details the core of Aethic reasoning, decoupling the Einsteinian flow of time from quantum collapse events. It establishes the first three Aethic postulates, defining informational reality as reference-dependent and using a two-generational model of state inheritance to distinguish coherence from decoherence.
